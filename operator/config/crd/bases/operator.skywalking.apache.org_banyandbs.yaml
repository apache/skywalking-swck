                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                            provisioner.
                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
