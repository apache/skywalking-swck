## How to add CRD and Controller in SWCK?

The doc is to help contributors who want to add CRD and Controller in SWCK focus on the coding and reduce the time overhead of configuring kubebuilder.

#### 1. Install the kubebuilder

> Notice, SWCK is built by kubebuilder v3+, so you need to install the kubebuilder after v3.0.0

SWCK is based on the [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder), and you could download the kubebuilder in the [releases](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases). 



#### 2. Create CRD and Controller

Then we can use `kubebuilder create api` to add a new CRD and corresponding controller. Here we use the `Demo` as an example, and you should replace it with your CRD.

```sh
$ cd operator && kubebuilder create api --group operator --version v1alpha1 --kind Demo(Your CRD)
```

Then you need to input twice `y` to create the Resource and Controller, and there will be some newly added files.

```sh
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

	controllers/operator/demo_controller.go
	controllers/operator/suite_test.go

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Next, we need to focus on the file `apis/operator/v1alpha1/demo_types.go` which defines your CRD, and the file `controllers/operator/configuration_controller.go` which defines the Controller. The others files are some configurations generated by the [kubebuilder markers](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers.html). Here are some references:

* [Kubebuilder project demo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/tree/master/testdata/project-v3), in which you can understand the overall architecture.

* [How to add new-api](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/new-api.html), which you can find more details for `oapserverconfig_types.go`.

* [Controller-overview](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/controller-overview.html), where you can find more details about `oapserverconfig_controller.go`.

At last, the `suite_test.go` can be deleted as we don't need it.



### 3. Create webhook

If you want to validate the field of your CRD, you need to create a webhook as follows.

```sh
kubebuilder create webhook --group operator --version v1alpha1 --kind Demo --defaulting --programmatic-validation
```

The newly generated files are as follows.

```sh
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   PROJECT
	modified:   config/webhook/manifests.yaml
	modified:   main.go

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	apis/operator/v1alpha1/demo_webhook.go
	apis/operator/v1alpha1/webhook_suite_test.go

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You can get more details through [webhook-overview](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/webhook-overview.html), and you also need to delete the file `webhook_suite_test.go`.



### 4. Create the template

Generally, a CRD will be associated with a series of resources, such as [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/), [rbac](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), etc. All template files are stored in the `./operator/pkg/operator/manifests`, you could create the directory there such as `demo`, and refer to the CRD templates in other folders to define your own template. What's more, we support defining your own template rendering function by setting up the [TmplFunc](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-swck/blob/master/operator/pkg/kubernetes/apply.go#L49). At last, you need to change the [comment](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-swck/blob/bf4d1346a9869f67187b9b9202bf14d190728c56/operator/pkg/operator/manifests/repo.go#L31) and add a field `demo` there to embed the template files into golang binaries.

>  Notice, every file under the template directory can only contain one resource and we can't use the `---` to create multiple resources in a single file.



### 5. Build and Test

SWCK needs to run in the k8s environment, so we highly recommend using the [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) as the test environment. There are currently two ways to test your implementation. 

>  Before testing, please make sure you have the kind installed. 

* Test locally. After finishing your implementation, you could use the following steps to test locally:

1. Disable the webhook

```sh
export ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

2. Run the main.go with the kubeconfig file.

```sh
go run main.go --kubeconfig=(use your kubeconfig file here, and the default is ~/.kube/config)
```

> If you want to test the webhook, please refer the [guide](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/running.html#running-webhooks-locally).

* Test in-cluster. 

1. Before testing the swck, please install cert-manager to provide the certificate for webhook in swck.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

2. At first, you should build the swck image and load it into the kind cluster, and then you could install the crds and the operator as follows.

```sh
make docker-build && kind load docker-image controller:latest && make install && make deploy
```

3. After the swck is installed, and then you could use the following command to get the logs produced by the operator. 

```sh
kubectl logs -f [skywalking-swck-controller-manager-*](use the swck deployment name) -n skywalking-swck-system
```
