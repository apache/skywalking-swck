# Apache SkyWalking Cloud on Kubernetes release guide

This documentation guides the release manager to release the SkyWalking Cloud on Kubernetes in the Apache Way, and also helps people to check the release for vote.

## Prerequisites

1. Close(if finished, or move to next milestone otherwise) all issues in the current milestone from [skywalking-swck](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-swck/milestones) and [skywalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/milestones), create a new milestone if needed.
2. Update [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md).
3. Update image tags of adapter and operator.


## Add your GPG public key to Apache svn

1. Log in [id.apache.org](https://id.apache.org/) and submit your key fingerprint.

1. Add your GPG public key into [SkyWalking GPG KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/KEYS) file, **you can do this only if you are a PMC member**.  You can ask a PMC member for help. **DO NOT override the existed `KEYS` file content, only append your key at the end of the file.**

## Build and sign the source code package

```shell
export VERSION=<the version to release>
git clone git@github.com:apache/skywalking-swck && cd skywalking-swck
git tag -a "v$VERSION" -m "Release Apache SkyWalking Cloud on Kubernetes $VERSION"
git push --tags
make clean && make release
```

The `skywalking-swck-${VERSION}-bin.tgz`, `skywalking-swck-${VERSION}-src.tgz`, and their corresponding `asc`, `sha512`. **In total, six files should be automatically generated in the directory.**

## Upload to Apache svn

```shell
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/
mkdir -p skywalking/swck/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-swck/build/release/skywalking-swck*.tgz skywalking/swck/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-swck/build/release/skywalking-swck*.tgz.asc skywalking/swck/"$VERSION"
cp skywalking-swck/build/release/skywalking-swck*.tgz.sha512 skywalking/swck/"$VERSION"

cd skywalking/swck && svn add "$VERSION" && svn commit -m "Draft Apache SkyWalking-SWCK release $VERSION"
```

```

## Vote Check

All PMC members and committers should check these before voting +1:

1. Features test.
1. All artifacts in staging repository are published with `.asc`, `.md5`, and `sha` files.
1. Source codes and distribution packages (`apache-skywalking-swck-{src,bin}-$VERSION.tgz`)
are in `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/swck/$VERSION` with `.asc`, `.sha512`.
1. `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are in source codes and distribution package.
1. Check `shasum -c apache-skywalking-swck-{src,bin}-$VERSION.tgz.sha512`.
1. Check GPG signature. Download KEYS and import them by `curl https://www.apache.org/dist/skywalking/KEYS -o KEYS && gpg --import KEYS`. Check `gpg --batch --verify apache-skywalking-swck-{src,bin}-$VERSION.tgz.asc apache-skywalking-swck-{src,bin}-$VERSION.tgz`
1. Build distribution from source code package by following this [the build guide](#build-and-sign-the-source-code-package).
1. Licenses header check.

Vote result should follow these:

1. PMC vote is +1 binding, all others is +1 no binding.

1. Within 72 hours, you get at least 3 (+1 binding), and have more +1 than -1. Vote pass. 

1. **Send the closing vote mail to announce the result**.  When count the binding and no binding votes, please list the names of voters. An example like this:

   ```
   [RESULT][VOTE] Release Apache SkyWalking Could on Kubernetes version $VERSION
   
   3 days passed, we’ve got ($NUMBER) +1 bindings:
   xxx
   xxx
   xxx
   ...
   (list names)
    
   I’ll continue the release process.
   ```

## Publish release

1. Move source codes tar balls and distributions to `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/`, **you can do this only if you are a PMC member**.

    ```shell
    export SVN_EDITOR=vim
    svn mv https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/skywalking/swck/$VERSION https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking/swck
    # ....
    # enter your apache password
    # ....
    ```
 
1. Remove last released tar balls from `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/skywalking`

1. Refer to the previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-website/pull/118), update news and links on the website. There are seven files need to modify.

1. Update [Github release page](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-swck/releases), follow the previous convention.
